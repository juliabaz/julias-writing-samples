### 1. INTRODUCTION
In fitness, a weight bench is a gym equipment used to perform strength training workouts. Its function is to support the body during the execution of free-weight exercises [1]. Its overall shape is that of a bench that can be adjusted to allow for different sitting positions. Once assembled, the weight bench measures 121.9 cm in length, 66 cm in width, and 106.7 cm in height [2]. The padded bench and backrest are covered with a soft textured mat black leather vinyl material, while its structural base is made out of shiny black powder-coated smooth textured steel. The most significant parts of the bench are the seat, the backrest, and the rollers.

### 2. SEAT
The padded seat is the part of the bench that supports most of the body’s weight, up to a maximum capacity of 400 lbs [2]. Its function is to allow for comfortable sitting during the performance of different strength training exercises. The seat is flat and U-shaped, with dimensions of 35 cm in width, 40 cm in length, and 6 cm in height [1]. It is made out of a firm, high density upholstery for good support, allowing for proper form during the workout. The seat is covered in a fine grain black leather vinyl fabric. It has a mat finish and a smooth waterproof texture that makes it easy to clean. Though the padded seat upholds most of the user’s mass, weight distribution on the bench is shared with the adjustable backrest.

### 3. BACKREST
The backrest is a cushioned board against which the user can lean while seated. It includes three levels of adjustments to allow the bench to be placed in flat, incline, and decline positions [2]. This feature allows the user to perform a range of full body exercises. The backrest board is a rectangular shape with a rounded top, and measures 35 cm in width, 80.9 cm in length, and 6 cm in height [1]. Its material composition is similar to the seat, with firm padding for shock absorption and a wrapping of smooth textured mat black leather vinyl. To insure proper form, the user must keep a straight back on the backrest, and keep legs perched on the rollers.

### 4. ROLLERS
Rollers are foam pads placed on exercise equipment for functionality and comfort. Their function is to prevent injuries by keeping the user’s legs firmly in place during the execution of upper body exercises. There are four cylindrical roller pads on the weight bench, each measuring 17 cm in length and 8 cm in diameter [1]. They are made out of high density foam, painted black with a mat finish, and placed around stainless steel rods. Their spongy textures provide a cushioning support to the knees and ankles.
